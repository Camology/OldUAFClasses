How to use 21-AI game by CKTitus:

Run using python3, might work with others not sure but I doubt it.

1. Input name for AI player, there is a default name if you press enter
2. Input AI type, "Advanced" is the only AI I made, anything
   else will default to random
3. Name your dealer, there is a default name if you press enter
4. Pick how many games, default is 1000

Let them play and await results.
